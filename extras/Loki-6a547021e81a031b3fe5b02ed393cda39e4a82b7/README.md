# ICS4U-Trojan(Loki)

This repository is a semester long project where I research and learn how to make malware with Python. 

More specifically, a trojan horse, a type of malware that diguises itself as something legitimate, but in reality, it is conducting malicous activity.

# To-Do List:

- Construct an actual useful app (Will be posted on another repo without malware)
- Ruin the app by creating malware
- Make malware collect information from user (keylogging?)
- Be hidden at first
- Make malware make copies of itself
- Creating certain triggers will cause malware to worsen
- Unclosable popups
- Funny adware
- Don't accidentally infect myself
- Try encrypt all files and ask for money in exchange for a key using trigger with cryptography
- Go crazy mode
- Backdoor to stop malware
- Send all info to a server
-
# Ideas for web or app
- Art software that embeds a script to the download of the file
- MLA checker that attaches a script
- Password Manager that steals your passwords
- Browser that tracks everything you do
- Video player that pauses if you are not looking at it (cannot be made malware? still funny)
- Notes software and calender that purposely change your notes and dates
- Music downloader and player
