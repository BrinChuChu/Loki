# ICS4U-Trojan(Loki)

This repository is a capstone where I research and learn how to make malware with Python. 

More specifically, a trojan horse, which is a type of malware that diguises itself as something legitimate, but in reality, it is conducting malicous activity.
This trojan uses sockets, os, and subprocess modules in Python.
