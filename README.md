# ICS4U-Trojan(Loki)

This repository is a capstone where I research and learn how to make malware with Python. 

More specifically, a trojan horse, which is a type of malware that diguises itself as something legitimate, but in reality, it is conducting malicous activity.

# To-Do List:

- Make backdoor to connect client and server (done)
- Allow server to send messages to client
- Allow server to control the system
- Allow server to run commands
- Allow server to access, download, and upload files from computer
- Make malware collect information from user (keylogging?)
- Unclosable popups
